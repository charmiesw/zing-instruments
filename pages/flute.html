            <b>Flute, wind instrument in which the sound is produced by a stream of air directed against a sharp edge, upon which the
            air breaks up into eddies that alternate regularly above and below the edge, setting into vibration the air enclosed in
            the flute. In vertical, end-vibrated flutes—such as the Balkan kaval, the Arabic nāy, and panpipes—the player holds the
            pipe end to his mouth, directing his breath against the opposite edge. In China, South America, Africa, and elsewhere, a
            notch may be cut in the edge to facilitate sound generation (notched flutes). Vertical nose flutes are also found,
            especially in Oceania. In transverse, or cross, flutes (i.e., horizontally held and side blown), the stream of breath
            strikes the opposite rim of a lateral mouth hole. Vertical flutes such as the recorder, in which an internal flue or
            duct directs the air against a hole cut in the side of the instrument, are known as fipple, or whistle, flutes. Flutes
            are typically tubular but may also be globular, as with the ocarina and primitive gourd flutes. If a tubular flute is
            stopped at the lower end, its pitch is an octave lower than that of a comparable open flute.<br><br>
        
            The earliest example of a Western end-blown flute was discovered in 2008 at Hohle Fels cave near Ulm, Ger. The flute,
            made from the bone of a griffin vulture, has five finger holes and measures about 8.5 inches (22 cm) long. It is thought
            to be at least 35,000 years old. Discoveries elsewhere in southwestern Germany yielded other flutes thought to be of
            similar age.<br><br>
        
            The characteristic flute of Western music is the transverse flute held sideways to the right of the player. It was known
            in ancient Greece and Etruria by the 2nd century BCE and was next recorded in India, then China and Japan, where it
            remains a leading wind instrument. In the 16th century the tenor flute, pitched in G, was played in consort with descant
            and bass flutes (pitched in D and C respectively). All were typically of boxwood with six finger holes and no keys,
            semitones being made by cross-fingering (uncovering the holes out of sequence), and retained the cylindrical bore of
            their Asiatic bamboo relatives. These 16th-century flutes were made obsolete late in the 17th century by the one-keyed
            conical flute, probably conceived by the celebrated Hotteterre family of makers and players in Paris. A conical flute is
            made in separate joints, the head joint being cylindrical, the others contracting toward the foot. Two joints were
            common in the 18th century, the upper being supplied in alternate lengths for tuning purposes. The instrument was known
            then as the flauto traverso, traversa, or German flute, as distinct from the common flute, usually called the recorder.</b>

            <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
            <p>Transverse flutes made out of animal bones were used in Europe in the Paleolithic era. These instruments can certainly
            be regarded as the ancestor of the flute. However, it was not until the sixteenth century during the Renaissance period
            that the prototype of the flute that plays such a prominent role in the modern orchestra first emerged and came into
            widespread use.<br><br>

            The term "flute" was originally applied both to pipe instruments held sideways and pipe instruments held vertically.
            Thus, the vertically held recorder was also called a "flute." Indeed, up until around the middle of the eighteenth
            century (the era of Baroque music), the word "flute" was commonly used to describe the recorder. To distinguish the
            transverse flute from the recorder, it was referred to in Italian as the flauto traverso, in German as the Querflöte,
            and in French as the flûte traversière-all of which mean "sideways held flute."</p>

            <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
            <p>The parts of the flute are numerous. Starting from the lip plate, the key mechanisms of the foot joint.
            All the parts of the flute serve a purpose that makes the flute function very well as a musical instrument.
            The flute is a member of the woodwind family, made of either wood, metal, or synthetic materials.
            Of course, there are different types of flutes, ranging from vessel flutes to transverse flutes.
            But the standard western concert C flute, which is also a transverse flute, is the most popular among them.
            The standard concert, or C flute, is a member of the western flute family. Other members of the western flute family are
            the piccolo, alto flute, and bass flutes.<br><br>
        
            The standard western concert C flute is generally made with metals like nickel-plated silver, gold, and other materials.
            But piccolo is commonly made with wooden bodies and metallic keys.
            Thus, the parts of the flute we are discussing here are part of the western flute family. We are not discussing parts of
            the bamboo flute or vessel flute. Therefore, we will discuss different parts of the western flute one after the other in detail. 
            Moreover, we will establish how each part functions and contributes to the general functionality of the flute. <br><br>
        
            The western concert flute is a simple metal tube that is relatively small. The flute is a tube, closed at the top and open at the bottom.
            Also, the tube has tone holes drilled along its sides at specific intervals. The key mechanism is attached to the tube on one side, 
            and it is used to open or close the tone holes. This action allows the instrument to create different tones and notes. But the tube 
            of the flute is not one piece of metal.<br><br>
            
            Generally, the tube is the main part of the flute, and it comes apart in three sections. These sections, known as
            joints, are listed below.<br><br></p>

            <ul>
                <li><i>The head joint</i></li>
                <li><i>The body joint</i></li>
                <li><i>The foot joint</i></li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>

            <p>Each of these three sections or joints has different parts that are peculiar to them. Tenons are a component of the flute 
            that are used to join all three joints together to form a complete instrument. When the three joints are joined together, 
            we will have a complete instrument.<br><br>
            
            <span>The instrument that we talking about is known as the modern concert C flute.</span>

            The diagram above is the pictorial representation of this part of the flute. The body joint connects both the head and foot joints 
            together to form a complete instrument. As we can see from the parts of a flute diagram, we have three joints. Also, each joint has different parts that further
            add to the functionality of the flute.
            All three joints are the three major parts of the flute. Each of them has different functionality, and they are very
            important.<br><br>

            All these parts make the flute a versatile instrument with a brilliant and sweet tone.The headjoint is where tone creation begins. 
            The flute produces the sound when the player accurately blows into the embouchure hole. The body joint has a key that can be used to control 
            the pitch of the tone produced by the flute. The tone changes when the tone hole is opened or closed by depressing the key. The footjoint 
            extends the range of the tone produced by the flute and has keys to achieve that.</p>

            <p>Flute can be played by people of all ages and skill level but the recommended age to start flute lessons is around 10 years
            old. It is one of the easiest instruments to learn and its size makes it easy to transport. The flute comes apart into
            three pieces, and packs into a very small case, ideal for carrying to and from band practice!<br><br>
