            <b>The Guitar is classified as a plucked string instrument, or chordophone, which produces sound by creating a vibration of
            the strings. They can have up to 18 strings depending on the type of guitar but most only have six. The sound is
            produced by creating vibration in the hollow body of an acoustic guitar or through an amplifier for an electric guitar.
            The guitar is traditionally made of wood and strings of gut, nylon or steel. Unlike hollow-bodied acoustic, electric
            guitars typically have a solid body to prevent feedback.<br><br>
            
            The strings are strummed or plucked using the fingers or a pick, and notes are achieved by pressing the strings against
            the fret on the neck of the instrument. The most common type of musical notation used for the guitar is tablature.
            Unlike typical Western musical notation which shows the notes on a staff, tablature shows the position of the fingers
            and the corresponding strings that should be plucked.<br><br>
            
            Originating in Spain, the guitar is one of the most widely used instruments in popular music throughout the world. The
            acoustic guitar has influenced many musical genres, including jazz, Western and Indian classical, mariachi, blues and
            folk. Additionally, the advent of the electric guitar and its loud, powerful sound was instrumental in the development
            of rock, blues and pop music. Unlike many string instruments, the guitar can have countless variations and
            modifications, making it popular in almost any genre.</b>

                    <p>An acoustic guitar is a musical instrument in the string family. When a string is plucked, its vibration is
                        transmitted
                        from the bridge, resonating throughout the top of the guitar. It is also transmitted to the side and back of the
                        instrument, resonating through the air in the body, and producing sound from the sound hole.[1] While the
                        original,
                        general term for this stringed instrument is guitar, the retronym 'acoustic guitar' - often used to indicate the
                        steel
                        stringed model-distinguishes it from an electric guitar, which relies on electronic amplification. Typically, a
                        guitar's body is a sound box, of which the top side serves as a sound board that enhances the vibration sounds
                        of
                        the
                        strings.

                    <p>An electric guitar is a guitar that requires external amplification in order to be heard at typical performance volumes,
                    unlike a standard acoustic guitar. It uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical
                    signals, which ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers. The sound is sometimes shaped or electronically
                    altered to achieve different timbres or tonal qualities from that of an acoustic guitar via amplifier settings or knobs
                    on the guitar. Often, this is done through the use of effects such as reverb, distortion and "overdrive"; the latter is
                    considered to be a key element of electric blues guitar music and jazz, rock and heavy-metal guitar-playing. Designs
                    also exist combining attributes of the electric and acoustic guitars: the semi-acoustic and acoustic-electric guitars.

                    <p>The classical guitar, also called Spanish guitar, is a member of the guitar family used in classical music and other
                    styles. An acoustic wooden string instrument with strings made of gut or nylon, it is a precursor of the modern
                    steel-string acoustic and electric guitars, both of which use metal strings. Classical guitars derive from the Spanish
                    vihuela and gittern of the 15th and 16th century. Those instruments evolved into the 17th and 18th-century baroque
                    guitarâ€”and by the mid-19th century, early forms of the modern classical guitar. Today's modern classical guitar was
                    established by the late designs of the 19th-century Spanish luthier, Antonio Torres Jurado.

                    <p>A silent guitar is a type of guitar with a solid or chambered body that converts the vibration of the strings into
                    electric current using a piezoelectric pickup. The body of the guitar does not amplify the vibration of the strings into
                    audible sound. Thanks to this, musicians can practice with headphones without disturbing people around them,[1] or
                    obtain an acoustic tone under heavy amplification without feedback. Las Vegas Academy has used silent guitars in a
                    classroom setting, with students wearing headphones to hear their instrument's sound.
