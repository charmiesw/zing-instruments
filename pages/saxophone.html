            <b>The saxophone (often referred to colloquially as the sax) is a type of single-reed woodwind instrument with a conical
            body, usually made of brass. As with all single-reed instruments, sound is produced when a reed on a mouthpiece vibrates
            to produce a sound wave inside the instrument's body. The pitch is controlled by opening and closing holes in the body
            to change the effective length of the tube. The holes are closed by leather pads attached to keys operated by the
            player. Saxophones are made in various sizes and are almost always treated as transposing instruments. A person who
            plays the saxophone is called a saxophonist or saxist.<br><br>
            
            The saxophone is used in a wide range of musical styles including classical music (such as concert bands, chamber music,
            solo repertoire, and occasionally orchestras), military bands, marching bands, jazz (such as big bands and jazz combos),
            and contemporary music. The saxophone is also used as a solo and melody instrument or as a member of a horn section in
            some styles of rock and roll and popular music.<br><br>
            
            The saxophone was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in the early 1840s and was patented on 28 June
            1846. Sax invented two groups of seven instruments each—one group contained instruments in C and F, and the other group
            contained instruments in B♭ and E♭. The B♭ and E♭ instruments soon became dominant, and most saxophones encountered
            today are from this series. Instruments from the series pitched in C and F never gained a foothold and constituted only
            a small fraction of instruments made by Sax. High-pitch (also marked "H" or "HP") saxophones tuned sharper than the
            (concert) A = 440 Hz standard were produced into the early twentieth century for sonic qualities suited for outdoor use,
            but are not playable to modern tuning and are considered obsolete. Low-pitch (also marked "L" or "LP") saxophones are
            equivalent in tuning to modern instruments. C soprano and C melody saxophones were produced for the casual market as
            parlor instruments during the early twentieth century, and saxophones in F were introduced during the late 1920s but
            never gained acceptance.<br><br>
            
            The modern saxophone family consists entirely of B♭ and E♭ instruments. The saxophones in widest use are the B♭ soprano,
            E♭ alto, B♭ tenor, and E♭ baritone. The E♭ sopranino and B♭ bass saxophone are typically used in larger saxophone choir
            settings, when available.</b>

            </div>
        
            <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
            <p>Adolphe Sax was a Belgian-born instrument-maker, flautist, and clarinetist working in Paris. He constructed saxophones
            in several sizes by the early 1840s, but he did not receive a patent for the instrument until June, 28 1846. The
            instrument was first officially revealed to the public in the presentation of his bass saxophone in C at an exhibition
            in Brussels in 1841. Sax also gave private showings to Parisian musicians in the early 1840s. He drew up plans for 14
            different types of saxophones, but they were not all realized.<br><br>
            
            The precise inspiration for the instrument is unknown, but there is good evidence that the saxophone was created by
            fitting a clarinet mouthpiece to an ophicleide, a type of conical bore, brass-keyed bugle. (Sax built ophicleides, among
            other instruments, in the late 1830s).<br><br>
            
            Sax's intent was to invent an entirely new instrument in order to provide bands and orchestras with a bass sound to
            compliment the woodwind and brass sections. (Tubas began to appear around this time with a similar purpose.) Sax's
            instrument would be capable of a more refined performance than the ophicleide, but with enough power to be used
            outdoors. Sax intended to harness the finesse of the woodwind with the power of a brass instrument. For a long time, the
            saxophone was restricted to military bands and not used in orchestral groups, due in part to Sax's tendency to offend
            rival instrument manufacturers, resulting in prejudice toward the man and his instrument.<br><br>
            
            For the duration of the patent, only the Sax factory could legally manufacture or modify the instrument. However this,
            along with a number of other of Sax's patents, were routinely breached by his rivals. After the patent expired in 1866,
            various manufacturers introduced competing models and made modifications to Sax's original design.</p>

            <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
            <p>The saxophone uses a single reed mouthpiece similar to that of a clarinet, but with a round or square evacuated inner
            chamber. It is considerably larger and has cork adjusting to the neck. The saxophone's body is effectively conical,
            giving it acoustic properties more akin to the oboe than to the clarinet. However, unlike the oboe, whose tube is a
            single cone, most saxophones have a distinctive curve at the bell.<br><br>
            
            Straight soprano saxophones are more common than curved ones, and very few straight alto, and tenor saxophones have been made, 
            as novelties. Straight baritone and C melody saxophones have occasionally been made as custom instruments, but were never 
            production items. There is some debate among players as to whether the curve affects the tone or not.</p>

            <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
            <p>Saxophones produce different notes using a key system consisting of pads and tone holes. A saxophone has 21 to 23 keys,
            depending on whether it has a high F#, a high G, or a low A key. (Since 1970, the high F# key has become common among
            intermediate and professional level instruments, while the high G key is found on only a few modern sopranos.) When
            pressure is applied to a key it opens or closes one or more of the tone holes by lifting or lowering a pad.<br><br>
        
            The pads, usually made of leather or an artificial material that acts as leather, cover tone holes and form an airtight
            seal, preventing any air from escaping. Depending on where this pad/tone hole combination is on the saxophone, it will
            raise or lower the pitch. Almost all woodwind instruments use the same idea to execute different notes, although the
            details of each instrument can differ greatly.</p>

            <p>The family of eight saxophones invented by Adolphe Sax and patented on March 21, 1846 is today focused on seven
            instruments.<br><br>

            Right from the beginning, the alto and tenor saxophones have been the models most in demand amongst composers. Other
            members of the family, although less commonly used, have appeared progressively throughout the evolution of the
            classical repertoire. Today jazz, contemporary music and various other musical styles are in the process of reclaiming
            all the instruments of the saxophone family under their ever diversifying branches.<br><br>
        
            let's identify who are these 7 kinds of saxophones.</p>

                            great
                            dexterity. Nevertheless, it has found a home within various saxophones ensembles and concert bands.

                            evokes that of the oboe, while its low register resembles the timbre of the English horn. In the saxophone

                            holds the role of first violin. Sydney Bechet introduced it into the United States upon his return from

                            But the baritone not only provides the bass voice of a quartet, it also constitutes the harmonic and

                        <p>The size, weight and cost of the B-flat bass saxophone limit its presence within groups. It always provides
                            an efficient
                            basis in wind sections and various ensembles. Today, it is more and more integrated into jazz and attracts
                            composers of
                            contemporary and improvised music.

                        <p>The saxophone double bass in E♭ is very seldom used today. Despite its ability to give off impressively deep
                            sounds, its
                            repertoire is practically non-existent. Few examples are in circulation, its development having been rarely
                            thoroughly
                            studied.
