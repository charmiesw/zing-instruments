            <b>The piano is a keyboard instrument that produces sound when the keys are pressed. Most pianos have a row of 88 black and
            white keys: 52 white keys for the notes of the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, and B) and 36 shorter and thinner black
            keys raised above the white keys and set further back, for sharps and flats. This means that the piano can play 88
            different pitches (or "notes"), spanning a range of a bit over seven octaves. The black keys are for the "accidentals"
            (F♯/G♭, G♯/A♭, A♯/B♭, C♯/D♭, and D♯/E♭), which are needed to play in all twelve keys.<br><br>
            
            There are two main types of piano: the grand piano and the upright piano. The grand piano offers better sound and more
            precise key control, making it the preferred choice when space and budget allow. The grand piano is also considered a
            necessity in venues hosting skilled pianists. The upright piano is more commonly used due to its smaller length and
            lower cost.<br><br>
            
            When a key is pressed down, the tightened strings inside are struck by felt-coated wooden hammers. The vibrations are
            transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies the sound by coupling the acoustic energy to the air. When
            the key is released, a damper stops the string's vibration, ending the sound. Most notes have three strings, except for
            the bass, which graduates from one to two. Notes can be sustained when the keys are released by the use of pedals at the
            base of the instrument, which hold the dampers off of the strings. The sustain pedal allows pianists to play movements,
            such as shifting hands from bass to treble range while sustaining a chord, enabling melodies and arpeggios on top.<br><br>
            
            In the nineteenth century, influenced by Romantic music trends, the fortepiano adopted changes such as using the cast
            iron frame (which allowed much greater string tensions), and aliquot stringing which gave grand pianos a more powerful
            sound, a longer sustain, and a richer tone. Later in the century, as the piano became more common, it allowed families
            to listen to a newly published musical piece by having a family member play a simplified version.<br><br>
            
            The piano is widely employed in classical, jazz, traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances,
            accompaniment, and for composing, songwriting and rehearsals. Despite its weight and cost, the piano's versatility,
            extensive training of musicians, and widespread availability in venues, schools, and rehearsal spaces have made it a
            familiar instrument in the Western world.</b><br>

            <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
            <p>The piano is an acoustic, keyboard and stringed musical instrument in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers
            that are coated with a softer material (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used
            leather). It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or
            strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings. It was invented in Italy
            by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain).

            <p>Some famous piano players from the early days of the piano include Dussek, Mozart, Muzio Clementi, John Field and
            Chopin. In the 19th century Franz Liszt was a very great influence on the piano by composing and performing very
            difficult music. Other great pianists include Clara Schumann and Anton Rubinstein. 20th century pianists include Artur
            Schnabel, Vladimir Horowitz, Josef Hofmann, Wilhelm Kempff, Dinu Lipati, Claudio Arrau, Artur Rubinstein, Sviatoslav
            Richter and Alfred Brendel. Among the greatest pianists today are Vladimir Ashkenazy, Daniel Barenboim, Leif Ove
            Andsnes, Boris Berezovsky and Evgeny Kissin.
            
            Pianists who play popular music include Liberace, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Elton John, Billy Joel, Thelonious
            Monk, Tori Amos and Ray Charles. Perhaps the greatest jazz pianist was Fats Waller.
            
            Also a number of modern harpsichordists and pianists have achieved success in fortepiano performance, including Paul
            Badura-Skoda, Malcolm Bilson, Andras Schiff, Kristian Bezuidenhout, Ronald Brautigam, Alexei Lubimov, duet Katie and
            Marielle Labeque, Yuan Sheng, Gary Cooper, Jörg Demus, Richard Egarr, Richard Fuller, Robert Hill, Geoffrey Lancaster,
            Vladimir Feltsman, Robert Levin, Steven Lubin, Bart van Oort, Trevor Pinnock, Viviana Sofronitsky, Andreas Staier,
            Melvyn Tan, Jos van Immerseel and Olga Pashchenko.

            <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
            <p>A piano has a keyboard with white keys and black keys. When a key is pressed down, the damper comes off the string and a
            hammer hits the string. It hits it very quickly and bounces off so that the string is free to vibrate and make a sound.
            Each key is a level that makes a hammer inside the piano hit a string inside, producing a sound. Each string has a
            different length and so produces-a different note. When the player takes their finger off the key the damper falls back
            onto the string and the sound stops. The strings are stretched very tightly across the frame, passing over a bridge on
            the way. The bridge touches the soundboard. This means that the vibrations are sent to the soundboard. The soundboard is
            a very important part of the piano. If it is damaged the piano will not make a sound.
            
            The mechanism which makes the hammer bounce off the string very quickly is called the “escapement”. In 1821 Sebastian
            Erard invented a kind of double escapement. This made it possible to repeat the note very quickly. The hammer only
            touches the string for about one thousandth of a second. The hammers are covered with felt which is a mixture of wool,
            silk and hair.
